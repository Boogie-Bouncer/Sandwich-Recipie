This is a small recipe which I always do in my free time when I am hungry.

Its simple,quick,and tasty too.

Just need all simple ingredients like bread,some vegetables,ketchup if you have. If not then no problem.

First we need to do the basic step which is to Butter all the breads so it as the aroma in the sandwich.

Then just prepare a mint chutney which basically is a paste of mint leaves and chutney so it taste better and also good for health.

Then put some slices of cheese or dry cheese if you have for the taste.

Then slice some cucumbers or some carrots and spread some on the cheese

Sprinkle some coriander leaves.

Slice 1 Onion and a small Tomato and arrange them over the top.

Dont make the sandwich too big or too small.

Add some salt and pepper on the vegies.

Cover it with another bread on top and gently press it a little so they all get mixed up and give the taste to it.

Cut it into pieces and add some ketchup if you want.

AND THATS IT....YOUR VEGETABLE SANDWICH IS READY TO GO IN YOUR STOMACH
